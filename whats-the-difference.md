# What's the difference between checklists, to-dos and swarms

## Checklists
Checklists are meant to be re-used time and time again. They are an ideal way to document processes - [personal to you](https://popshare.co/checklists) or for [your team](https://popshare.co/team-checklist-templates). A good example of team checklist would be a teammate on-boarding process.

## To-dos
A personal to-do list ideally used once and then archived. A good example of this would be a shopping list. To-dos here are for personal use. 

## Swarms
[Swarms](https://popshare.co/swarms) are like to-dos but shared with your teammates. This is the heart of Popshare and getting things done.
